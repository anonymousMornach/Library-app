Sure! Here's an example of an extremely detailed documentation for the app:

### Installation

To run the Book App locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository.git
   ```

2. Change into the project directory:

   ```
   cd libraryapp
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

The Book App should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

### Usage

The Book App provides the following features:

1. **Search**: Enter a title or author in the search input and click the "Search" button to search for books matching the query. The results will be displayed in the book list section.

2. **Pagination**: Navigate through the pages of the book list using the "Previous Page" and "Next Page" buttons. The current page number is displayed between the buttons.

3. **Sorting**: Use the sort dropdown to select a sorting option (by title or author). Click the "Sort" button to apply the selected sorting option to the book list.

4. **Authenticated Books**: The app also displays a list of authenticated books, fetched from the `/api/books/secure` endpoint using an API key provided via the `x-api-key` header.

### API Endpoints

The Book App interacts with the following API endpoints:

1. `GET /api/books`: Fetches all books.
2. `GET /api/books/secure`: Fetches authenticated books using an API key.
3. `GET /api/books/search?query={searchQuery}`: Searches for books based on the provided `searchQuery`.
4. `GET /api/books?page={page}`: Fetches books for the specified `page`.
5. `GET /api/books/sort?sortBy={sortBy}`: Fetches books sorted by the specified `sortBy` (title or author).

### Components

The Book App consists of the following components:

1. `App`: The main component that represents the entire application.
2. `SearchForm`: Renders the search form with an input field and a submit button.
3. `BookList`: Displays the list of books.
4. `Pagination`: Handles pagination and renders the "Previous Page" and "Next Page" buttons.
5. `SortDropdown`: Renders the sorting dropdown menu and sort button.
6. `AuthenticatedBooks`: Displays the list of authenticated books.

### State

The Book App maintains the following state variables using the React `useState` hook:

1. `books`: An array of books fetched from the API.
2. `searchQuery`: The current search query entered by the user.
3. `currentPage`: The current page number for pagination.
4. `sortBy`: The selected sorting option (title or author).
5. `authenticatedBooks`: An array of authenticated books fetched using the API key.

### Functions

The Book App defines the following functions:

1. `fetchBooks`: Fetches all books from the `/api/books` endpoint and updates the `books` state variable.
2. `fetchAuthenticatedBooks`: Fetches authenticated books from the `/api/books/secure` endpoint using an API key and updates the `authenticatedBooks` state variable.
3. `searchBooks`: Performs a search for books based on the `searchQuery` state variable by making a GET request to the `/api/books/search` endpoint and updates the `books` state variable with the search results.
4. `fetchBooksByPage`: Fetches books for the specified page number by making a GET request to the `/api/books` endpoint with the `page` query parameter and updates the `books` state variable.
5. `fetchSortedBooks`: Fetches books sorted by the specified `sortBy` (title or author) by making a GET request to the `/api/books/sort` endpoint with the `sortBy` query parameter and updates the `books` state variable.
6. `handleSearchChange`: Updates the `searchQuery` state variable with the value entered in the search input field.
7. `handleSearchSubmit`: Handles the submission of the search form by calling the `searchBooks` function.
8. `handlePageChange`: Updates the `currentPage` state variable and fetches books for the specified page by calling the `fetchBooksByPage` function.
9. `handleSortChange`: Updates the `sortBy` state variable with the selected value from the sorting dropdown.
10. `handleSortChange`: Handles the sorting of books by calling the `fetchSortedBooks` function.

### Styling

The Book App uses CSS for styling. The class names used in the components are as follows:

1. `container`: Styles the main container of the app.
2. `search-form`: Styles the search form container.
3. `book-list`: Styles the container for the book list.
4. `book-item`: Styles each book item in the list.
5. `pagination`: Styles the pagination container.
6. `sort-dropdown`: Styles the sorting dropdown container.
7. `no-results`: Styles the message displayed when no results are found.

Feel free to customize the CSS styles according to your preferences.

### Error Handling

The Book App includes basic error handling for API requests. If an error occurs during the API calls, an error message will be logged to the console using `console.error`. The error message will provide information about the specific error encountered.

It's recommended to implement additional error handling and feedback mechanisms based on your specific requirements, such as displaying error messages to the user or providing fallback options in case of API failures.
